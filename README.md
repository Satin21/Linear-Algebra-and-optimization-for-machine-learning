# LAOML Project 2 building a neural network to claissfy based on reduced features.


We have added a python script for each function/class separately.

run main.py as a standalone file it contains importing the other files for different functions. 

Please see Layer.py file that contains the activations functions, loss functions as well as defining layers
and neurons.

Building on it nn.py which constructs the neural network.

In each script, we added comments.
